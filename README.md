<h1>🎯 The Objectives 🎯</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an app for an association I'm a member of, La Fête du Clip, that will be used during our music videos blindtests.</p>
<p>The point is to have a hub witch two screens :</p>
<ul>
<li> One for managing the music videos playlist and counting teams points (and at some point, to edit metadatas of the files for better database management),</li>
<li> The other for streaming videos, pictures, and banners.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h2>User Target</h2>
<p>The members of the association that host the blindtests need an app to launch on their computer and that they don't need to configure.</p>
<br/>
